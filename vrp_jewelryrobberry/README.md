## vrp_jewelryrobberry

The script includes areas for jewelry collection with alarm to the police when the robbery begins.

Dependency:
- [vRP](https://github.com/DunkoUK/dunko_vrp)
- [mhacking](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-simple-hacking-minigame/62095)

The script is not optimized to the maximum, in case someone wants to optimize it before republishing it in its own github respository or in fivem releases, it is obliged to communicate it to me and request my authorization.
At that time when you download it you can change it to your liking without any problem but you cannot store it on third-party sites or fivem or github sites.
