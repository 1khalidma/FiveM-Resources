# vrp_HackingLight
The script allows you to hack an external panel from the city's power station (marked on the map with a blip) in order to enter open the security door and thus be able to get to the machinery. Beware that the machines have a failure rate so you could get shocked and sometimes even die. The script also allows you to repair these electricity stations by calling a technician.
